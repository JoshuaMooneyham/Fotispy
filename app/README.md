Here are the baseline requirements. Your application must:

Allow Users to:
    [x] sign-up
    [x] login
    [x] logout
    [x] create new data in the system that is associated with the user
    [x] update data in the system that is associated with the user
    [x] read data from the system that is associated with the user
    [x] delete data in the system that is associated with the user
    [x] Use Form objects to validate user data
    [x] Use appropriate database relationship fields to model    relationships between data
    [x] Restrict some pages to logged in users
    [~] Utilize Permissions (and possibly Groups) to control user    authorization. For example:
        [x] You app could have an admin or moderator user group that has more permissions than a standard user.
        [~] You app could involve two different kinds of users that use the website in complementary ways. For example:
            * Github Classroom: Teachers create assignments that they give to students
            * LinkedIn: Companies create jobs that candidates apply to
            * Uber: Riders request rides, and a Driver provides rides
